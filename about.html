            <p>
                Our target audience consists of teens, adults, and teens, adults and
                movie enthusiasts. That's because according to our research, most
                teens who watch documentaries are Asians and are favored both by men
                and women. Adults of 18-25 years old are most likely to watch
                documentaries. Most of them are Asian women. Lastly, movie enthusiasts
                of 16-29 years olds like watching documentaries.

            <h1>Why we chose documentaries</h1>
            <p>
                We chose to do it in documentaries because we think that documentaries
                give valuable content that people like to watch and be captivated by.
                Documentaries deal exclusively with facts and real-life events and the
                main purpose of a documentary is to inform and educate. Another reason
                why we chose documentaries is because of the needs of our target
                audience and we assume this is what they need. Teens need to be
                informed and enlightened of the recent happenings. Adults need to be
                engaged in these kinds of conflicts. Movie enthusiasts need to
                entertain themselves from their work/studies.

    <div class="journey">
        <h1 class="title" style="text-align: center">Our journey making a YouTube channel</h1>

        <br>

        <p>
            Our journey begins in quarter one where we got to choose the type of
            content that we want to make. Then in quarter two, our groupings were
            changed forcing us to redecide which type of content we are going to
            make again. At first, we decided on educational videos but eventually
            ended up with documentaries. We did try to switch our type of content
            again but we still ended up choosing to make documentaries.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            After choosing our type of content, we then had to decide on our brand.
            Basically, we had to decide on the name and logo of our channel. Here is
            where trouble happens since we don't have any creative minds, I decided
            to just generate random names and we will just pick which one we like.
            That's how we got our name. For the logo, one of our members was a
            "graphic designer" so they were assigned with making the logo.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            Finally, after all of that, we began to plan our first video. The video
            was about Sitio Bebe, a fictional place that our teachers came up with
            as a school project for us to do. Though it was fictional, it was a good
            first topic for our video. Since we already had some information for it
            and we said "Why not? It's our first video plus it might be good
            practice for us". Then we started to make plans for the video. We made a
            storyboard and a script for the video, we also assigned roles to some of
            the members. After making the plans, we then proceeded to record the
            video and then edit it. After making some final changes and a thumbnail
            for the video, we then uploaded it to YouTube.
        </p>

        </div>

        <br><br><br>

        <p>
            After some time after uploading the first video, we then made plans for
            the second video. At first, we didn't know what topic to talk about in
            the video since we didn't plan that far ahead. But we eventually landed
            on the idea of talking about the Willow Project. Then we made a
            storyboard, and a script, and assigned tasks to members just like in the
            first video. But it was somewhat different from the first video. In the
            last video, we recorded footage while in the second video, we planned to
            just do an entire video that is full of voiceovers. We knew that this
            would be more challenging to edit but we continued with the idea and
            recorded the voiceovers. After recording, our editor edited the video,
            and the video was revised a lot before eventually getting it into a
            state that we liked. Our graphic designer then made a thumbnail and we
            uploaded the second video to YouTube.
